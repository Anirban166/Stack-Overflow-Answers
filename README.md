# Stack Overflow Answers
---

This repository contains most of my code snippets (from answers) posted on Stack Overflow. (Mostly C++) <br>
- Filenames here are the question titles. 
- There is a link to the corresponding SO question in each file.
- Code snippets are seperated by an auto-generated newline.
- Contains some full programs (tested via online compilers such as Jdoodle and the ones available on Godbolt) but not my full answer. (only code here)
